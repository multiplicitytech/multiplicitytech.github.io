          <p>To me, what the recent Gamestop saga epitomized was not the glorious win (and the defeat) of the retail investors. It was not the power of Reddit to distribute and coordinate people nor lawsuits after. To me, it represented an overblown anecdote of a rare success that very few traders have -- a dangerous one that lured more people to trade dangerously for an almost non-existent chance of betting against the house.</p>

          <p>Millennials and Gen-Z in a way were left by many systematic factors to bet on outsized returns as the only hope. Shaped by multiple world-shaping recessions like the global financial crisis, we fear the financial markets at large that made people homeless and jobless. We are saving less not because of buying <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/may/15/australian-millionaire-millennials-avocado-toast-house" >avocado toast</a> but because of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/" >no real income growth</a>. In many developed countries inflation-adjusted increase in wages has been close to zero for 90-99% of the population. House ownership, given the astronomical real estate prices in comparison to stagnant income growth is unthinkable in most countries without active government intervention. Additionally, employee benefits and pension schemes are much rarer due to both companies cutting benefits and the rise of the &ldquo;gig economy&rdquo;.</p>

          <p>GDP and economic activities at large have grown, especially with unprecedented stimulus money from governments. Yet, how much this is trickling down to those who need it is unclear. This is evident in a recent survey that asked young Americans what they would do with the money. Most said stock market and bitcoin [insert number]</p>

          <p class="figureText"><br>Figure 1: Rising wealth inequality in the US<br>Source: <a target="_blank" href= "https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/">Pew Research</a></p>

          <p>Systematic inequality and loss of faith in welfare are only partial reasons for the rise of inexperienced retail investors that make risky bets. Like most complexities of the real world, money management is a spectrum. Yet, we are never taught the nuances that stretch from bank deposits all the way to futures contracts.</p>

          <p>There is a lot that our decades-old education system has failed to adapt and account for, money being a big part of it. After all, money is emotionally charged, unfair and uncomfortable to talk about. How could we change that without being taught the language to discuss it? The questions on how one should earn and manage money and what it means to make a living have grossly different answers in this decade compared to the last, yet the few lessons we often learn from our parents are a belated retrospective that no longer applies.</p>
          <p>As we seek our own money answers in this digital world, we look to technology-enabled financial services solutions, or so called Fintech apps. There's a breadth of solutions that digitize payments, digital banking and investing but for one, gamified trading is not the answer we need.</p>

          <p>The retail-facing trading apps like Robinhood or Interactive Brokers have now become so widely used, especially after the lockdowns of 2020 and stimulus money. They market with a mission to &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/our-mission/" >democratize finance</a>&rdquo; but their commission-free trading scheme offered to anyone without sufficient financial knowledge screening echoes the business models of Big Tech where if you're not paying for the product, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/doug-rushkoff-hello-etsy" >you are probably the product</a>.</p>

          <p>We have suffered many consequences, including the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.security.org/resources/data-tech-companies-have/" >loss of data control</a>, because we did not question tech platforms early enough on their business models, and whether they align with the users' interests. A recent <a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606A%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q1%202020.pdf" >SEC filing</a> showed that in Q1 of 2020, Robinhood's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjpnz5/robinhoods-customers-are-hedge-funds-like-citadel-its-users-are-the-product" >controversial business model</a> has generated almost $100 million from Citadel Securities and the other <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp" style="border-bottom: none !important"><span class="tooltip-m">market makers<span class="tooltiptext-m">an individual market participant or member firm of an exchange that also buys and sells securities for its own account</span></span></a>, who in turn make profit from both price volatility and volume of stocks. Most users sign up for Robinhood with a simple objective of making money.</p>

          <p>These companies, however, are not necessarily interested in aligning with users as long as there is volatility and volume. In fact, these apps have been criticized for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-03/robinhood-weighs-scrapping-its-confetti-animation-after-scrutiny" >encouraging</a> such speculation by design, despite active trading <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/attention-robinhood-power-users-most-day-traders-lose-money.html" >reliably leading to negative returns</a>, even for professionals. A <a target="_blank" href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=320069123112084112087107085082005009049040064078088068077088100101087088065000126011054057055004118051018069084126017023011030015048049051033113024082119004025046076021028074002010092112085100070115127083074070005083065071072115025066126003092&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE" >recent study</a> on Robinhood trading data showed that returns are worse for users who may rely on the app's attention-inducing features like stock rankings. Data showed that if users bought Robinhood's top 10 newly purchased stocks, they would have 5%-9% less returns than the S&P 500 index in the next month. The authors added that &ldquo;large increases in Robinhood users are often accompanied by large price spikes and are followed by reliably negative returns.&rdquo; The herd of inexperienced investors have little data to make trading decisions with, so they are biased towards the most visible information on the app and thus end up trading &ldquo;more aggressively than other retail investors.&rdquo; Indeed, Robinhood has inflicted <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/technology/robinhood-risky-trading.html" >devastating and fundamental damages</a> on some of its novice users.</p>

          <p>So what is the answer to this overwhelming question that is money? In the midst of having systematic cards stacked against us, the most important answer is education. Financial literacy should be the basis of challenging any systematic biases and disadvantages ingrained in our societies. Money for the short and long history of the capitalist world is an undisputed enabler of privilege begetting more privilege, often at the cost of others. Once we detach complexity, ignorance, and shame from money, we will more freely and loudly voice what is working and what is not.</p>

          <p>Whether it is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_investing" style="border-bottom: none !important"><span class="tooltip-m">value investing<span class="tooltiptext-m">an investment paradigm that involves buying securities that appear underpriced</span></span></a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/art/talks/indexed_investing.htm" style="border-bottom: none !important"><span class="tooltip-m">index investing<span class="tooltiptext-m">an investing strategy designed to match a market, not beat it</span></span></a>, there have been plenty of studies that confirm that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/mutual-funds/diversification" >diversified</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/how-to-invest/impact-of-costs" >low-fees</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2020/11/12/passive-attack" >passive</a> investments do generally well in the long run. Many of us spend 1-2 decades studying and the next 3-4 employed, but nowhere near as much on learning how to grow money. We should think early on of what retirement might look like for us (if it ever comes) and what our financial goals are. Can one ever afford a house? How much will one need to retire comfortably?</p>

          <p>We also need to understand the time value of money -- the quantifiable opportunity cost of ignorance and inaction -- and learn that no one will take care of our financial wealth if we do not. For example, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/#overview" >S&P 500</a> returned 18.4% in 2020 and 31.49% in 2019. Simply tracking the market, which 50% of the market, including the largest sovereign, pension, and private investment funds, already does, would have done significantly well, better than <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/18/stock-picking-has-a-terrible-track-record-and-its-getting-worse.html" >85% of large cap active fund managers</a>.</p>

          <p class="figureText"><br>Figure 3: Tracking the market most often outperforms active investment<br>Source: <a target="_blank" href= "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/06/this-chart-shows-how-depressing-life-has-been-for-stock-pickers.html/">CNBC</a></p>

          <p>There are increasingly diverse Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) funds that support social causes, including racial equity and sustainability, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/articles/esg-investment-returns-starting-to-outperform-other-mutual-funds-etfs" >provide better returns</a> at the same time. Some ETF examples include the <a target="_blank" href="https://etfdb.com/etf/ICLN/#etf-ticker-profile" >iShares Global Clean Energy ETF</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.adasinaetf.com/" >Adasina Social Justice All Cap Global ETF</a>, both of which are positively screened funds with less than 1% gross expense ratios (fund operating fees). This allows not only underserved causes to be better funded but also underserved investor segments to take interest and get involved in taking a stance while growing money.</p>
          <p>What technology has enabled us to do with money can be a net positive. Once we educate ourselves on the options and decide on the best course of action, we can benefit from the commission-free broker apps like Robinhood to easily buy low cost products which we believe will generally grow in value over time. We can also lean on digital financial advisory apps if they align well with our financial interests, which is usually evident in their fee structure.</p>

          <p>The Gamestop saga may have ended as just that - a story, but <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/04e6c524-389b-47fc-afaa-eb52c1e76048" >with many losers</a>. The game may never stop, sothe least we can do is to educate ourselves to be on the right side of the game and to demand better consumer-aligned products, without <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-to-remove-controversial-digital-confetti-from-trading-app-11617195612" >funfettis</a>.</p>
