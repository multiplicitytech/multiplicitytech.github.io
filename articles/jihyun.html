          <img class="titleImage" src="jihyun2/title.png"><br>
          
          <p>We do not know enough about money. There is a lot that our decades-old education system has failed to adapt and account for and money is a big part of it. Everyday, we make micro and macro decisions involving money, yet the proportion of our secondary education spent on equipping us for making the right financial decisions is nowhere near enough. A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oecd.org/daf/fin/financial-education/G20-OECD-INFE-report-adult-financial-literacy-in-G20-countries.pdf">recent study</a> by OECD found that on average across G20 countries, fewer than half of adults (48%) could answer 70% of the financial knowledge questions correctly. 
          </p>

          <p>Even though educational attainment is positively correlated with financial literacy, <a target="_blank" href="https://gflec.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/economic-importance-financial-literacy-theory-evidence.pdf">it is also not sufficient</a>. In the same <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oecd.org/financial/education/oecd-infe-2020-international-survey-of-adult-financial-literacy.pdf">OECD study</a>, young people (aged 18-29) appeared to have lower financial literacy and financial attitude scores than the rest of the sample consistently and significantly. They also tend to have lower financial knowledge and less prudent financial behaviour. </p>

          <p>Yet the costs of financial ignorance are high, especially for young people today. There are systematic disadvantages that the millennials and gen Z face: less support from pension schemes, unaffordable housing and lower bar to access complex financial products.</p>

          
          <p>For one, our generation will not be able to retire <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ftadviser.com/pensions/2018/11/08/young-people-too-poor-to-retire-at-same-age-as-parents/">at the same age as our parents</a>. Rising life expectancy combined with lower birth rates, interest rates and economic growth have strained many <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-13/world-s-retirees-risk-running-out-of-money-a-decade-before-death">national</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://qz.com/1723882/low-interest-rates-are-killing-corporate-pension-plans/">employer-sponsored</a> pension systems around the world. For example, the size of the world’s collective retirement savings gap could exceed $400 trillion by 2050, up from $70 trillion in 2015, according to <a target="_blank" href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Investing_in_our_Future_report_2019.pdf">this World Economic Forum report</a>. </p>

          <div id="chart1">
            <script type="text/javascript" src ="jihyun2/chart1.js"></script>
          </div>
          <p class="figureText"><br>Figure 1: The expanding retirement savings gap<br>Source: <a target="_blank" href= "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-13/world-s-retirees-risk-running-out-of-money-a-decade-before-death">Bloomberg</a></p>

          <p>Given such pension deficits worldwide, the burden of financing one’s retirement is increasingly placed on the individual away from governments or firms. Especially given a highly mobile and flexible workforce today, the responsibilities to save, invest, and spend wisely throughout the life cycle are imposed on the individual.</p>

          <p>Retirement is made even more difficult with difficulty in owning housing. According to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/98729/millennial_homeownership_0.pdf">Urban Institute</a>, the millennial homeownership rate in the U.S is 7.0%-7.2% lower than the homeownership rate among baby boomers and Gen Xers when they were ages 18 to 34. More education debt, high rental payments, and low income growth prevent the young people from saving enough for an emergency fund, let alone a down payment. </p>

          <p>Financial ignorance carries significant costs. Consumers who fail to understand the concept of interest compounding spend more on transaction fees, run up bigger debts, and incur higher interest rates on loans (Lusardi and Tufano, 2015; Lusardi and de Bassa Scheresberg, 2013). They also end up borrowing more and saving less money (Stango and Zinman, 2009). Meanwhile, the potential benefits of financial literacy are manifold. People with strong financial skills do a better job planning and saving for retirement (Behrman et al., 2012; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014). Financially savvy investors are more likely to diversify risk by spreading funds across several ventures (Abreu and Mendes, 2010). </p>

          <p>In other work, we have shown that financial literacy is closely tied to retirement planning and retirement wealth accumulation (Behrman et al., 2010; Lusardi, 2009; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011). Yet many people are woefully unaware of basic economics and finance, shortfalls that may lead them to make serious and often irreversible mistakes.</p>

          <p> In return, the digital native generation has such easy access to fintech products for opening a bank account, getting loans, trading stocks and cryptocurrencies. Especially in developing countries, financial inclusion has been a key agenda aided by mobile technology. COVID-19 has further accelerated fintech adoption. <a target="_blank" href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=052114126020107064111115095113000068003073060063089051009001097007127096089083018096016098107123058045018005091098065087005122001084005023040011089097019091072090038018078085100122071091030031018095124126115022104096024083025024068079092024097102126&EXT=pdf&INDEX=TRUE">This study</a> from Swiss Finance Institute found that the spread of COVID-19 and related government lockdowns have led to 24%-32% increase in the relative rate of daily downloads of finance mobile applications in 74 countries. </p>

          <p> Bored and hopeless with stimulus checks, young people turned to trading apps like Robinhood to bet on outsized returns as only hope. Despite the unverified levels of financial literacy, many retail investors now had access to complex and risky financial products from their mobile phones. The trading platforms promised commission-free, fun and easy trading to “<a target="_blank" href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/our-mission/">democratize finance</a>”. Paired with viral headlines like Gamestop, individuals were lured to easy and quick wins as long as they had access to Robinhood, Reddit and Youtube tutorials.</p>

          <p class="figureText"><br>Figure 2: Robinhood's revenue streams<br>Source: <a target="_blank" href= "https://lex.substack.com/p/long-take-how-robinhood-makes-90mm">The Fintech Blueprint</a></p>

          <p>What these companies don’t promise is being aligned with the users’ financial interests, as long as there is volatility and volume. In fact, these apps have recently been criticized for <a target="_blank">encouraging</a> such speculation by design, despite active trading <a target="_blank">reliably leading to negative returns</a>, even for professionals. A <a target="_blank">recent study</a> on Robinhood trading data showed that returns are worse for users who may rely on the app’s attention-inducing features like stock rankings. Data showed that if users bought Robinhood’s top 10 newly purchased stocks, they would have 5%-9% less returns than the S&P 500 index in the next month. The authors added that “large increases in Robinhood users are often accompanied by large price spikes and are followed by reliably negative returns.”</p>

          <p>The herd of inexperienced investors have little data to make trading decisions with, so they are biased towards the most visible information on the app and thus end up trading “more aggressively than other retail investors.” </p>
         
         <p> The devastating effect of individuals accessing riskiest financial products without proper education has never been more <a target="_blank">so evident or tangible</a> and they disproportionately affect those who are much less financially resilient. Many users, however, still fail to understand that trading is not investing. Brokerage apps are not financial advisors; they make money not from giving clients advice but from offering them to trade often and in large volumes. A recent <a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606A%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q1%202020.pdf">SEC filing</a> showed that in Q1 of 2020, Robinhood’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjpnz5/robinhoods-customers-are-hedge-funds-like-citadel-its-users-are-the-product">controversial business model</a>, despite being commission-free, has generated almost $100 million from Citadel Securities and the other <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp#:~:text=A%20market%20maker%20is%20a,exceeds%20the%20bid%20price%20a">market makers</a>, who in turn make profit from both price volatility and volume of stocks.</p>

         <p>During the past decade of Big Tech dominance, we’ve learned the hard way that when we are not paying for the product, we are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/doug-rushkoff-hello-etsy">probably the product</a>. We have suffered many consequences, including the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.security.org/resources/data-tech-companies-have/">loss of data control</a>, because we did not question tech platforms early and sufficiently on their business models and whether they align with the users’ interests.</p>


          <p>So what is the answer to this overwhelming question that is money? In the midst of having systematic cards stacked against us, the most important answer is education. Financial literacy should be the basis of challenging any systematic biases and disadvantages ingrained in our societies. Money, in the history of capitalism, has always been the most powerful enabler of privilege and begetting more privilege, often at the cost of others. We need to detach complexity, ignorance, and shame from money so that we can more freely and loudly voice what is working and what is not.</p>

          <p>To start, we need to understand two important concepts: compounding interests and diversification. Whether it is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_investing" style="border-bottom: none !important"><span class="tooltip-m">value investing<span class="tooltiptext-m">an investment paradigm that involves buying securities that appear underpriced</span></span></a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://web.stanford.edu/~wfsharpe/art/talks/indexed_investing.htm" style="border-bottom: none !important"><span class="tooltip-m">index investing<span class="tooltiptext-m">an investing strategy designed to match a market, not beat it</span></span></a>, there have been plenty of studies that confirm that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/mutual-funds/diversification" >diversified</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/how-to-invest/impact-of-costs" >low-fees</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2020/11/12/passive-attack" >passive</a> investments do generally well in the long run. We should think early on of what retirement might look like for us (if it ever comes) and what our financial goals are. Can one ever afford a house? How much will one need to retire comfortably?
</p>

          <p>We also need to understand the time value of money -- the quantifiable opportunity cost of ignorance and inaction -- and learn that no one will take care of our financial wealth if we do not. For example, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500/#overview" >S&P 500</a> returned 18.4% in 2020 and 31.49% in 2019. Simply tracking the market, which 50% of the market, including the largest sovereign, pension, and private investment funds, already does, would have done significantly well, better than <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/18/stock-picking-has-a-terrible-track-record-and-its-getting-worse.html" >85% of large cap active fund managers</a>.</p>

          <div id="chart3">

          </div>
          <p class="figureText"><br>Figure 3: Tracking the market most often outperforms active investment<br>Source: <a target="_blank" href= "https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/the-sp-500-index-out-performed-hedge-funds-over-the-last-10-years-and-it-wasnt-even-close/">AEI</a></p>

          <p>There are increasingly diverse Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) funds that support social causes, including racial equity and sustainability, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/articles/esg-investment-returns-starting-to-outperform-other-mutual-funds-etfs" >provide better returns</a> at the same time. Some ETF examples include the <a target="_blank" href="https://etfdb.com/etf/ICLN/#etf-ticker-profile" >iShares Global Clean Energy ETF</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.adasinaetf.com/" >Adasina Social Justice All Cap Global ETF</a>, both of which are positively screened funds with less than 1% gross expense ratios (fund operating fees). This allows not only underserved causes to be better funded but also underserved investor segments to take interest and get involved in taking a stance while growing money.</p>
          <p>What technology has enabled us to do with money can be a net positive. Once we educate ourselves on the options and decide on the best course of action, we can benefit from the commission-free broker apps like Robinhood to easily buy low cost products which we believe will generally grow in value over time. We can also lean on digital financial advisory apps if they align well with our financial interests, which is usually evident in their fee structure.</p>

          <p>The Gamestop saga may have ended as just that - a story, but <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/04e6c524-389b-47fc-afaa-eb52c1e76048" >with many losers</a>. The game may never stop, sothe least we can do is to educate ourselves to be on the right side of the game and to demand better consumer-aligned products, without <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robinhood-to-remove-controversial-digital-confetti-from-trading-app-11617195612" >funfettis</a>.</p>
