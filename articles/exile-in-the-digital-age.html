               <div class="ticker_item"><b>&ldquo;Reflections on Exile&rdquo; by Edward Said — </b> Exile is strangely compelling to think about but terrible to experience. It is
                the unhealable rift forced between a human being and a native place, between
                the self and its true home: its essential sadness can never be surmounted. And
                while it is true that literature and history contain heroic, romantic, glorious,
                even triumphant episodes in an exile’s life, these are no more than efforts
                meant to overcome the crippling sorrow of estrangement. The achievements
                of exile are permanently undermined by the loss of something left behind
                forever.
                But if true exile is a condition of terminal loss, why has it been
                transformed so easily into a potent, even enriching, motif of modern culture?
                We have become accustomed to thinking of the modern period itself as
                spiritually orphaned and alienated, the age of anxiety and estrangement.
                Nietzsche taught us to feel uncomfortable with tradition, and Freud to regard
                domestic intimacy as the polite face painted on patricidal and incestuous rage.
                Modern Western culture is in large part the work of exiles, émigrés, refugees.
                In the United States, academic, intellectual and aesthetic thought is what it is
                today because of refugees from fascism, communism, and other regimes
                given to the oppression and expulsion of dissidents. The critic George Steiner
                has even proposed the perceptive thesis that a whole genre of twentiethcentury Western literature is “extraterritorial,” a literature by and about exiles,
                symbolizing the age of the refugee. Thus Steiner suggests:
                It seems proper that those who create art in a civilization of quasi-barbarism, which has made
                so many homeless, should themselves be poets unhoused and wanderers across language.
                Eccentric, aloof, nostalgic, deliberately untimely …
                In other ages, exiles had similar cross-cultural and transnational visions,
                suffered the same frustrations and miseries, performed the same elucidating
                and critical tasks—brilliantly affirmed, for instance, in E. H. Carr’s classic
                study of the nineteenth-century Russian intellectuals clustered around Herzen,
                The Romantic Exiles. But the difference between earlier exiles and those of
                our own time is, it bears stressing, scale: our age—with its modern warfare,
                imperialism, and the quasi-theological ambitions of totalitarian rulers—is
                indeed the age of the refugee, the displaced person, mass immigration.
                Against this large, impersonal setting, exile cannot be made to serve
                notions of humanism. On the twentieth-century scale, exile is neither
                aesthetically nor humanistically comprehensible: at most the literature about
                exile objectifies an anguish and a predicament most people rarely experience
                first hand; but to think of the exile informing this literature as beneficially
                humanistic is to banalize its mutilations, the losses it inflicts on those who
                suffer them, the muteness with which it responds to any attempt to understand
                it as “good for us.” Is it not true that the views of exile in literature and,
                moreover, in religion obscure what is truly horrendous: that exile is
                irremediably secular and unbearably historical; that it is produced by human
                beings for other human beings; and that, like death but without death’s
                ultimate mercy, it has torn millions of people from the nourishment of
                tradition, family, and geography?
                To see a poet in exile—as opposed to reading the poetry of exile—is to see
                exile’s antinomies embodied and endured with a unique intensity. Several
                years ago I spent some time with Faiz Ahmad Faiz, the greatest of
                contemporary Urdu poets. He was exiled from his native Pakistan by Zia’s
                military regime, and found a welcome of sorts in strife-torn Beirut. Naturally
                his closest friends were Palestinian, but I sensed that, although there was an
                affinity of spirit between them, nothing quite matched—language, poetic
                convention, or life-history. Only once, when Eqbal Ahmad, a Pakistani friend
                and a fellow-exile, came to Beirut, did Faiz seem to overcome his sense of
                constant estrangement. The three of us sat in a dingy Beirut restaurant late
                one night, while Faiz recited poems. After a time, he and Eqbal stopped
                translating his verses for my benefit, but as the night wore on it did not matter.
                What I watched required no translation: it was an enactment of a homecoming
                expressed through defiance and loss, as if to say, “Zia, we are here.” Of
                course Zia was the one who was really at home and who would not hear their
                exultant voices.
                Rashid Hussein was a Palestinian. He translated Bialik, one of the great
                modern Hebrew poets, into Arabic, and Hussein’s eloquence established him
                in the post-1948 period as an orator and nationalist without peer. He first
                worked as a Hebrew language journalist in Tel Aviv, and succeeded in
                establishing a dialogue between Jewish and Arab writers, even as he espoused
                the cause of Nasserism and Arab nationalism. In time, he could no longer
                endure the pressure, and he left for New York. He married a Jewish woman
                and began working in the PLO office at the United Nations, but regularly
                outraged his superiors with unconventional ideas and utopian rhetoric. In
                1972 he left for the Arab world, but a few months later he was back in the
                United States: he had felt out of place in Syria and Lebanon, unhappy in
                Cairo. New York sheltered him anew, but so did endless bouts of drinking and
                idleness. His life was in ruins, but he remained the most hospitable of men.
                He died after a night of heavy drinking when, smoking in bed, his cigarette
                started a fire that spread to a small library of audio cassettes, consisting
                mostly of poets reading their verse. The fumes from the tapes asphyxiated
                him. His body was repatriated for burial in Musmus, the small village in Israel
                where his family still resided.
                These and so many other exiled poets and writers lend dignity to a
                condition legislated to deny dignity—to deny an identity to people. From
                them, it is apparent that, to concentrate on exile as a contemporary political
                punishment, you must therefore map territories of experience beyond those
                mapped by the literature of exile itself. You must first set aside Joyce and
                Nabokov and think instead of the uncountable masses for whom UN agencies
                have been created. You must think of the refugee-peasants with no prospect of
                ever returning home, armed only with a ration card and an agency number.
                Paris may be a capital famous for cosmopolitan exiles, but it is also a city
                where unknown men and women have spent years of miserable loneliness:
                Vietnamese, Algerians, Cambodians, Lebanese, Senegalese, Peruvians. You
                must think also of Cairo, Beirut, Madagascar, Bangkok, Mexico City. As you
                move further from the Atlantic world, the awful forlorn waste increases: the
                hopelessly large numbers, the compounded misery of “undocumented” people
                suddenly lost, without a tellable history. To reflect on exiled Muslims from
                India, or Haitians in America, or Bikinians in Oceania, or Palestinians
                throughout the Arab world means that you must leave the modest refuge
                provided by subjectivity and resort instead to the abstractions of mass politics.
                Negotiations, wars of national liberation, people bundled out of their homes
                and prodded, bussed or walked to enclaves in other regions: what do these
                experiences add up to? Are they not manifestly and almost by design
                irrecoverable?
                We come to nationalism and its essential association with exile.
                Nationalism is an assertion of belonging in and to a place, a people, a
                heritage. It affirms the home created by a community of language, culture,
                and customs; and, by so doing, it fends off exile, fights to prevent its ravages.
                Indeed, the interplay between nationalism and exile is like Hegel’s dialectic of
                servant and master, opposites informing and constituting each other. All
                nationalisms in their early stages develop from a condition of estrangement.
                The struggles to win American independence, to unify Germany or Italy, to
                liberate Algeria were those of national groups separated—exiled—from what
                was construed to be their rightful way of life. Triumphant, achieved
                nationalism then justifies, retrospectively as well as prospectively, a history
                selectively strung together in a narrative form: thus all nationalisms have their
                founding fathers, their basic, quasi-religious texts, their rhetoric of belonging,
                their historical and geographical landmarks, their official enemies and heroes.
                This collective ethos forms what Pierre Bourdieu, the French sociologist, calls
                the habitus, the coherent amalgam of practices linking habit with inhabitance.
                In time, successful nationalisms consign truth exclusively to themselves and
                relegate falsehood and inferiority to outsiders (as in the rhetoric of capitalist
                versus communist, or the European versus the Asiatic).
                And just beyond the frontier between “us” and the “outsiders” is the
                perilous territory of not-belonging: this is to where in a primitive time peoples
                were banished, and where in the modern era immense aggregates of humanity
                loiter as refugees and displaced persons.
                Nationalisms are about groups, but in a very acute sense exile is a solitude
                experienced outside the group: the deprivations felt at not being with others in
                the communal habitation. How, then, does one surmount the loneliness of
                exile without falling into the encompassing and thumping language of
                national pride, collective sentiments, group passions? What is there worth
                saving and holding on to between the extremes of exile on the one hand, and
                the often bloody-minded affirmations of nationalism on the other? Do
                nationalism and exile have any intrinsic attributes? Are they simply two
                conflicting varieties of paranoia?
                These are questions that cannot ever be fully answered because each
                assumes that exile and nationalism can be discussed neutrally, without
                reference to each other. They cannot be. Because both terms include
                everything from the most collective of collective sentiments to the most
                private of private emotions, there is hardly language adequate for both. But
                there is certainly nothing about nationalism’s public and all-inclusive
                ambitions that touches the core of the exile’s predicament.
                Because exile, unlike nationalism, is fundamentally a discontinuous state
                of being. Exiles are cut off from their roots, their land, their past. They
                generally do not have armies or states, although they are often in search of
                them. Exiles feel, therefore, an urgent need to reconstitute their broken lives,
                usually by choosing to see themselves as part of a triumphant ideology or a
                restored people. The crucial thing is that a state of exile free from this
                triumphant ideology—designed to reassemble an exile’s broken history into a
                new whole—is virtually unbearable, and virtually impossible in today’s
                world. Look at the fate of the Jews, the Palestinians, and the Armenians.
                Noubar is a solitary Armenian, and a friend. His parents had to leave
                Eastern Turkey in 1915, after their families were massacred: his maternal
                grandfather was beheaded. Noubar’s mother and father went to Aleppo, then
                to Cairo. In the middle-sixties, life in Egypt became difficult for nonEgyptians, and his parents, along with four children, were taken to Beirut by
                an international relief organization. In Beirut, they lived briefly in a pension
                and then were bundled into two rooms of a little house outside the city. In
                Lebanon, they had no money and they waited: eight months later, a relief
                agency got them a flight to Glasgow. And then to Gander. And then to New
                York. They rode by Greyhound bus from New York to Seattle: Seattle was the
                city designated by the agency for their American residence. When I asked,
                “Seattle?,” Noubar smiled resignedly, as if to say, better Seattle than Armenia
                —which he never knew, or Turkey, where so many were slaughtered, or
                Lebanon, where he and his family would certainly have risked their lives.
                Exile is sometimes better than staying behind or not getting out: but only
                sometimes.
                Because nothing is secure. Exile is a jealous state. What you achieve is
                precisely what you have no wish to share, and it is in the drawing of lines
                around you and your compatriots that the least attractive aspects of being in
                exile emerge: an exaggerated sense of group solidarity, and a passionate
                hostility to outsiders, even those who may in fact be in the same predicament
                as you. What could be more intransigent than the conflict between Zionist
                Jews and Arab Palestinians? Palestinians feel that they have been turned into
                exiles by the proverbial people of exile, the Jews. But the Palestinians also
                know that their own sense of national identity has been nourished in the exile
                milieu, where everyone not a blood-brother or sister is an enemy, where every
                sympathizer is an agent of some unfriendly power, and where the slightest
                deviation from the accepted group line is an act of the rankest treachery and
                disloyalty.
                Perhaps this is the most extraordinary of exile’s fates: to have been exiled
                by exiles—to relive the actual process of up-rooting at the hands of exiles. All
                Palestinians during the summer of 1982 asked themselves what inarticulate
                urge drove Israel, having displaced Palestinians in 1948, to expel them
                continuously from their refugee homes and camps in Lebanon. It is as if the
                reconstructed Jewish collective experience, as represented by Israel and
                modern Zionism, could not tolerate another story of dispossession and loss to
                exist alongside it—an intolerance constantly reinforced by the Israeli hostility
                to the nationalism of the Palestinians, who for forty-six years have been
                painfully reassembling a national identity in exile.
                This need to reassemble an identity out of the refractions and
                discontinuities of exile is found in the earlier poems of Mahmoud Darwish,
                whose considerable work amounts to an epic effort to transform the lyrics of
                loss into the indefinitely postponed drama of return. Thus he depicts his sense
                of homelessness in the form of a list of unfinished and incomplete things</div>

                <p>Growing up, I was not exposed to much literature or films on the Palestinian experience; my understanding of it — culturally, politically, and personally — was limited. But, attending a diverse educational institution for my undergraduate degree propelled me towards Palestinian literature, cinema, and poetry in a desperate attempt to make sense of my Palestinianess. Of course, that process was not exempt from Edward Said’s seminal thoughts and essays. 
                </p>

                    Edward Said was a Palestinian-American intellectual and a professor at Columbia University who was one of the pioneers of the field of postcolonial studies. Said wrote extensively on his <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~germ43/pdfs/said_reflections.pdf">experience being exiled</a>, <a  target="_blank" href="https://janeaustensummer.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/culture_and_imperialism.pdf">on culture and imperialism</a>, on <a  target="_blank" href="https://monoskop.org/images/4/4e/Said_Edward_Orientalism_1979.pdf">orientalism</a>, and on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57546.The_Question_of_Palestine">question of Palestine</a>. Unlike Said, I did not experience <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/exile" style="border-bottom: none !important"><span class="tooltip-m">exile<span class="tooltiptext-m">the state of being barred from one's native country</span></span></a> first hand but was instead born into it. I also grew up with the internet and on the internet, thus, at times, was negotiating barriers and accessabilities of a different kind. Yet, it struck me how relevant and personal Said’s writing felt; even though it was highly specific at times, it was still applicable now, decades later, when my generation’s experience of exile is largely shaped and mediated by a different &ldquo;world&rdquo;: the internet. </p>

                <div class="right">
                <p>Of course, this applicability is in large part due to the still ongoing Palestinian struggle, but is also due to the reality that the internet is not as different a world as we think or would like it to be. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    While it is true that many of the challenges exiles experience have eased due to the internet’s facilitation, Said’s articulation of these challenges still deeply resonate with my understanding and observations — as an exile and technologist myself — of the ways the internet is and is not allowed to work. Ultimately, the internet is just another human invention, enabled and flawed by the same humans and systems which create and support it. In an attempt to reconcile how the ideas Said reflects on in his writing — including mobility, language, and solitude — manifest, rather than disappear, on the internet, both algorithmically and socially, I present in this article a brief &ldquo;internet&ldquo; reading of Said’s essay &ldquo;<a  target="_blank" href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/~germ43/pdfs/said_reflections.pdf">Reflections on Exile.</a>” In this article, I will be responding to excerpts from his essay with, as in the original essay, a personal reflection that is ripe with facts, opinions, and questions in place of answers. </p>

          <!-- Section 1: On Mobility & Immobility -->
    <div class = "subtitle">
        <h3><b>On Mobility and Immobility</b></h3>
    <div class="paper"><p class="paper-text"> “Borders and barriers, which enclose us within the safety of familiar territory, can also become prisons, and are often defended beyond reason or necessity. Exiles cross borders, break barriers of thought and experience.”</p>

                <p>Negotiating borders and barriers is an inevitable reality for exiles. Those include language barriers, cultural and religious barriers, country borders, and more. With time, and over generations of exile, some barriers become more prominent than others. Ideally, on the internet, lots of these barriers are meant to be broken: we can access information and connect in many forms to different points all around the world. What this means is that I can have access to my exilic homeland and the people of my exilic homeland can also have access to me via the thoughts and media we can share online. All of this can alleviate the overwhelming feeling of estrangement that is at the center of the exilic experience. However, realistically, while the internet removes many barriers, it still allows many others to exist and even thrive. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    One important barrier is language as we experience the internet <a  target="_blank" href="http://labs.theguardian.com/digital-language-divide/">differently</a> depending on the language(s) we operate in. Many diasporic communities no longer operate in their native tongues — at least not online, especially if they speak English, a lingua franca — and thus cannot afford this ease of access to the content and people of their exilic homelands, who still largely operate in their native tongues, and vice versa. <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM11/paper/view/2856/3250">Studies</a> have shown that Twitter users largely restrict their interactions to those who speak the same online language as them. Thus, our ideas and thoughts are mostly restricted to those of us who are similarly a part of the diaspora, and how much we actually know about the experiences and thoughts of the people in our exilic homelands is quite <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/KitchaFitFit1/status/1275532636635758593/photo/1" style="border-bottom: none !important"><span class="tooltip-m">limited<span class="tooltiptext-m"><img src="lujain/meme.png" width="100%"></span></span></a>.

Whether it’s actual human beings as moderators or machine learning algorithms, social media companies seem to have repeatedly <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xwk9zd/how-facebook-content-moderation-works">failed</a> to appropriately moderate content, while simultaneously not violating people’s democatric rights to speak freely.

                Facebook, for instance, has <a  target="_blank" href="https://7amleh.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/booklet-final2-1.pdf">taken down</a> Palestinian accounts and content numerous times. And, so has <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.thecanary.co/global/world-news/2019/11/03/journalists-accuse-twitter-of-censorship-as-it-suspends-multiple-news-accounts-from-palestine-and-lebanon/">Twitter</a>. Just a few months ago, Instagram <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/15/bella-hadid-deleted-instagram-post-palestinians-silenced">removed</a> supermodel Bella Hadid's post of her father’s passport, which states his birthplace as Palestine, claiming that the simple father’s day post violates their community guidelines on harassment and bullying. </p>
                <p>Following this incident, Hadid publicly called out the platform: </p>
                    <blockquote><i>Are we not allowed to be Palestinian on Instagram? This, to me, is bullying. You can’t erase history by silencing people. It doesn’t work like that.</i></blockquote>
                        
                    <p>This pushed Instagram to apologize to Hadid and explain that it was a “mistake” meant to protect the privacy of their users even though the picture she shared had the passport number blurred out. Additionally, only a few weeks ago, legal scholar and human rights attorney Noura Erakat <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/4noura/status/1289555387834753032" style="border-bottom: none !important"><span class="tooltip-m">reported<span class="tooltiptext-m"><img src="lujain/tweet.jpg" width="100%"></span></span></a> that Facebook took down her post about the killing of her cousin at a checkpoint in Palestine. Facebook claimed that the post violates its community standards on “harrassment and bullying.”
                    </p>
           <p> While social media platforms may be working hard to tackle misinformation, credibility, and privacy concerns, it is often at the expense of already marginalized communities as well as at the expense of credible <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/citizen_journalism" style="border-bottom: none !important"><span class="tooltip-m">citizen journalism.<span class="tooltiptext-m">the collection, dissemination, and analysis of news & information by the general public, especially by means of the internet.</span>
          </span></a> This selective censorship — both explicit through removing content and implicit through recommendation algorithms — limits what we are allowed to be exposed to and what we are not and forms remarkable barriers that restrict mobility in cyberspace.

        <h3><b>On the Privileges and Benefits of Exile</b></h3>
        <div class="paper"><p class="paper-text">“I speak of exile not as a privilege, but as an alternative to the mass institutions that dominate modern life. Exile is not, after all, a matter of choice: you are born into it, or it happens to you. But, provided that the exile refuses to sit on the sidelines nursing a wound, there are things to be learned: he or she must cultivate a scrupulous (not indulgent or sulky) subjectivity.”</p>

                    <p>One could argue that &ldquo;learning&rdquo; is no longer attached to physical mobility. In other words, this privilege of learning that was previously attached, at least to the one-time, physical mobility that is afforded to exiles is no longer that exclusive a privilege given the internet’s facilitation of information access. There is no denying that the internet has provided us with a never-ending bank of knowledge. However, firstly, this assumes everyone has equal access or has access at all — a naive and faulty assumption given that only approximately <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/">59%</a> of the global population actually have internet access. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even if one does have access, not all &ldquo;accesses&rdquo; are created equal. Wherever we are in the world, we cannot ignore the <a  target="_blank" href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs181/projects/1998-99/nuremberg-files/censorship.html">role</a> of the privately, governmentally, or publicly owned organizations through which we access the internet, also known as internet service providers (ISPs), in mediating our access to information by censoring and blocking different sites and to different extents when convenient.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, the undeniable digital language divide means that depending on the language you operate in, your access to information through Google searches or social media searches is a very different experience compared to others who operate in a different language. Different is not always good — especially if you do not speak English.
                        </p>

               <p> An Oxford <a  target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/a44674">study</a> by Mark Graham and Matthew Zook on Google searches in the West Bank showed that searches in Arabic usually result in only 20% to 25% of the number of results the same search term brings in English. At a time when most of our information has migrated to the digital realm, the privilege of speaking a Western language online, which many, but of course not all, exiles do, is quite notable. 
               </p>
               <p>
                While it helps to separate what is online from what is offline, the line between the two is as blurry as ever as we use the internet to guide even the smallest of our daily activities. The same study I reference above also shows that a search for the word restaurant on Google Maps using three different languages (Arabic, English, and Hebrew) leads users to different parts of the same city for dining options. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These examples of oppression embedded in the economy and infrastructure of the internet show how imperialist structures are allowed to thrive online, and consequently in real life, unchecked and targeting communities in a reinvented colonialism: cyber colonialism. Some of these infringements on internet and information access, which the UN <a  target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/un-says-internet-access-is-a-human-right-2016-7">deems</a> a &ldquo;fundamental human right,&rdquo; are a serious concern. </p>

    <!-- Section 3: On Nationalisms and Solitudes -->
    <div class = "subtitle">
        <h3><b>On Nationalisms and Solitudes</b></h3>
   <div class="paper"><p class="paper-text">“Nationalisms are about groups, but in a very acute sense exile is a solitude experienced outside the group: the deprivations felt at not being with others in the communal habituation… The exile is offered a new set of affiliations and develops new loyalties. But there is also a loss of critical perspective, of intellectual reserve, of moral courage… Exiles look at non-exiles with resentment. They belong in their surroundings, you feel, whereas an exile is always out of place. What is it like to be born in a place, to stay and live there, to know that you are of it, more or less, forever?”
    </p>
    </div></div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            <div class = "left">
                <p>These new sets of &ldquo;affiliations&rdquo; and &ldquo;loyalties,&rdquo; based on experiences that transcend nationalisms, can be understood through “<a  target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@oliconner/key-concept-structure-of-feeling-42fecc8f7430" style="border-bottom: none !important"><span class="tooltip-m">structures of feeling<span class="tooltiptext-m">the idea that we &lsquo;feel&rsquo; things before we &lsquo;think&rsquo; things</span>
                </span></a>” rather than the solidity of nationalisms. They also eventually create groups of their own. A simple manifestation of this is the concept of allyship and solidarity that has grown in popularity and impact with the growth of the internet and globalization. For instance, a loyalty to justice can be a shared loyalty among different peoples from all around the world. The internet, like social media, allows us to better realize these shared values among exilic, refugee, and marginalized communities globally. The African American struggle in the United States is <a  target="_blank" href="https://mondoweiss.net/2017/05/historical-palestinian-solidarity/">undoubtedly</a> tied to the Palestinian struggle and the internet makes it easier to see that, participate in it, and form a new sense of belonging to something that, unlike nationalisms, is not as strictly territorially bound. 
                </p>
            </div>
            </div>
        <div class="column">
            <div class="right">
           <p> Another example is the literal creation of "groups," like Facebook <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/subtle-asian-traits-subtle-curry-traits-take-over-the-internet/10558888">meme groups</a>, based on shared cultural and lived experiences, that once again the internet allows us to discover and participate in. Some of these groups, like <span class="tooltip-m">Subtle Asian Traits<span class="tooltiptext-m">1,892,698 members as of July 2020</span></span> and <span class="tooltip-m">Subtle Curry Traits<span class="tooltiptext-m">817,999 members as of July 2020</span></span>, create a sense of belonging centered on the diasporic experience. As human nature has us continually searching for some kind of feeling of belonging that, as Said describes it, fulfils this &ldquo;deprivation&rdquo; of not physically being with others who share &ldquo;similar&rdquo; experiences, the internet allows us to creatively and at a much larger scale explore and form new &ldquo;affiliations.&rdquo;

    While there’s a long way to go in creating an open and inclusive internet, I cannot deny what this new world has given me and many others: the ability to see photos of my homeland literally taken today within a few clicks, the ability to call family I’m separated from with a single link, and the ability to participate in what aspires to be a campaign of constant global communication and education. But, as we experience the extremes of the benefits and injustices of the internet, perhaps this &ldquo;originality of vision&rdquo; we might have acquired can help us create a new, healthy internet to rule.
