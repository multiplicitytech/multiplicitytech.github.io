With a child’s playfulness, she grabs her older brother’s phone to create a Facebook account for herself. Her 25-year-old brother finds out, fumes at her actions, and gets into a heated argument with her that ends with him fatally stabbing her. The <a href="https://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/man-charged-manslaughter-stabbing-death-14-year-old-sister" target="_blank">incident</a> sparks national outrage, especially on social media where the very platform that was used to justify this unfathomable crime was used to put pressure on law-enforcement to inflict justice and charge her brother with manslaughter. We do not know the young girl’s name or who she was, because her attempt to create a social presence for herself online led to her life being taken. </p> <p>It is worth noting that the Covid-19 pandemic has caused a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-women-mideast-trfn/seek-help-say-middle-east-womens-groups-as-domestic-violence-surges-idUSKBN21P23M" target="_blank">surge</a> in domestic violence, mostly affecting women and girls worldwide. As quarantine measures have led to a sharp increase in social media usage by 50-70%, that inherently led to a <a href="https://arabstates.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2020/04/brief-online-and-ict-facilitated-violence-against-women-and-girls-during-covid-19" target="_blank">rise</a> in social media related violence against women and girls around the world. Social media is often present in the nightmare stories of “honor crimes” that continue to haunt Jordan and Jordan’s neighboring countries as well. For instance, recently, an 18-year old Syrian girl called Rasha was brutally murdered in what was deemed an “honor crime.” Rasha was the first victim of a social media page dedicated to publishing what they refer to as “scandals and sexual relations”, including posts with women’s details and pictures. Rasha’s older brother shot her to “wash away his shame” while social media users watched live...</p><p>Simultaneously, as social media weaves itself more and more into societal fabric, it’s becoming the chosen platform for some women to seek help. In another <a href="https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2020/3/31/jordanian-woman-alleges-family-abuse-under-coronavirus-lockdown" target="blank">incident</a> in Jordan, Eman Alkhateeb, a 36-year-old single mother, took to social media to detail the increasing domestic violence she suffers at home at the hands of her brother and mother. Even though social media gave her a platform to seek help and her video went viral, restrictions on movement, the lack of law enforcement, and overwhelmed governmental family protection departments meant that little <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-women-mideast-trfn/seek-help-say-middle-east-womens-groups-as-domestic-violence-surges-idUSKBN21P23M" target="_blank">help</a> could be provided. </p> <p>These stories, among countless others, demonstrate that social media requires much needed reform and interventions to make it a safer space for women. A space where women can find support, not where their perpetrators are comfortable <a href="https://www.mediasupport.org/honor-killings-mores-soaked-in-womens-blood/" target="_blank">live streaming</a> “honor” crimes committed against them. Policymakers, worldwide, need to formulate <a href="https://www.apc.org/sites/default/files/Legal_Analysis_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">regulations</a> that can combat the “capabilities of social media in furthering GBV both online and offline.”</p>');

        $('.luj').html('<h4>On Online Solidarity</h4><img src="dana-deemah/greece.png" width="100%"><p>On the other side of the Mediterranean, in June of the same year, lockdown orders instigated a new beginning for another Middle Eastern woman, Layla. After years of enduring an abusive marriage, she packed her bags and left Greece to move to another country with her children. Layla had been archiving evidence of her husband’s abuse through photos and voice messages, which she would share discreetly with her close network via Whatsapp for them to save as she couldn’t keep them on her own phone. She later used that evidence when applying for asylum in the other country. In Layla’s case, the social messaging platform empowered her to escape abuse and find help.</p> <p>In light of the pandemic, organizations serving women and fighting for their rights have attempted to <a href="https://daraj.com/en/45279/" target="_blank">adapt</a> to social distancing restrictions by providing virtual services, running awareness campaigns, and allocating temporary shelters for women suffering from increased domestic violence. Even though many societies consider domestic violence a private, family matter, making it exceptionally hard for most women to report abuse or ask for help, organizations tried to facilitate online solidarity and support through small initiatives that provided women with a continued sense of community that reminds them that they are not alone. Amidst worldwide lockdown orders, Melissa Network, a network serving and empowering refugee and migrant women in Greece, created a Facebook group for its former and present participants that served as an online diary during quarantine. Women shared posts and photos of their quarantine activities, thoughts, and content they engaged with.</p> <p>From the bustling city of Cairo, Nadeen Ashraf brought the global #meToo movement home when she started the instagram account @assaultpolice, exposing a sexual predator in her college campus who’s been getting away with harassing, blackmailing, and assaulting women for quite a long time.The account instantly exploded with followers, testimonies from women, and chilling accounts of assault and rape by the same man. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/world/middleeast/egypt-metoo-sexual-harassment-ashraf.html" target="_blank">mobilization</a> that resulted from this Instagram account led to a speedy arrest and trial. The account later grew to report other instances of sexual violence and bring them to the public eye, as well as to focus on educating women on their rights. </p> <p>Despite the, sometimes fatal, consequences of the internet, it can be utilized as a powerful tool for reform, changing public perception and even inspiring legal amendments. Recently, online voices denouncing violent practices like “honor crimes” in countries like Jordan and Lebanon have become louder...loud enough that governmental efforts, resulting from  societal pressure to silence these online voices by banning media reports and public discussions, did not suffice. Activists continue to demand legislative procedures that impose justice instead of discrimination and tribal law. Such online awareness can push for <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/rising-against-so-called-honor-killings-jordan" target="_blank">offline changes</a>; the Jordanian government, for example, has opened a shelter to protect women whose lives are threatened by domestic abuse, when the only solution prior to that was to imprison them in the hopes of protecting them from their families. </p>');

The “Eye on Women”, a program launched by the Solidarity Is Global Institute (SIGI) to monitor the 2020 Elections from a gender perspective, revealed that 1 in 3 women had reported experiencing <a href="https://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/1-3-women-parliamentary-candidates-face-cyberbullying-%E2%80%94-study" target="_blank">cyberbullying</a>. 20% of the female candidates reported offline forms of harassment, such as their banners being torn or vandalized with demeaning comments, as well as online violence in the form of slandering, cursing, and commenting on their appearances on social media platforms. </p> <p>Only 15 women were elected to the 130-deputy Jordanian House of Representatives, <a href="https://themedialine.org/people/following-election-jordan-sees-drop-in-female-lawmakers/" target="_blank">down</a> from 20 in the outgoing body.</p>');

        $('.luj').html('<h4>On Online Bias</h4><img src="dana-deemah/profile-viewers.png" width="100%"><p>The gendered online experience exists everywhere. Some of these experiences are more universal than others; one example is how social media has virtualized the “<a target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-does-the-male-gaze-mean-and-what-about-a-female-gaze-52486" style="border-bottom: none !important"><span class="tooltip-m">male gaze<span class="tooltiptext-m">The “male gaze” invokes the sexual politics of the gaze and suggests a sexualised way of looking that empowers men and objectifies women</span></span></a>.” Since its inception, Facebook’s function was to display photographs of people for viewers’ consumption, which can be interpreted as a form of social surveillance, as <a href="https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/the-male-gazed" target="_blank">empirical research</a> has shown that women make up the majority of viewed profiles on Facebook, and men make up the majority of viewers. On the other hand, some aspects of bias are context-specific —a core issue that is often ignored. The gap in research on online bias against Middle Eastern women is part of the bias problem. However, drawing from <a href="https://nyupress.org/9781479837243/algorithms-of-oppression/" target="_blank">research findings</a> on bias against Black and Latina women online, it is clear how search algorithms on search engines like Google contribute to the maintenance and dissemination of racism and sexism against women of color. Online bias against women should be explored from both a global and a local, in this case Middle-Eastern, lens. Western and international media and platforms are not the sole culprits here – Middle Eastern media also plays a significant role in <a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/countering-negative-image-arab-women-arab-media-toward-pan-arab-eye-media-watch" target="_blank">perpetuating</a> the degrading images of Middle Eastern women as primarily “being concerned with cooking, cosmetics, and gossip”, and depicting women as dependent followers and consumers who are too emotional to make rational decisions. To create a more equitable and empowering internet, it is imperative to study how biases against Middle Eastern women play out online and examine how offline biases and biases portrayed by Middle Eastern and international media feed into the online world.</p>');
