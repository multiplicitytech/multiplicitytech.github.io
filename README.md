# Multiplicity

[Multiplicity](http://www.multiplicitytech.tech) is an online curation examining the impact of tech on our youth & societies. 

### Usage

* In the terminal, navigate to the location of this GitHub repo on your PC, and run `npm install` and then run `npm start`. If either don't work, make sure you have npm and gulp installed on your computer. It will open a browser with the website, typically at the address "localhost: 3000/"

* Changes are pushed to the live website every time you push to master. If you don't want changes to reflect on the website yet, you can make your own branch and push to it until they're finalized.

* You don't need to open any of the 'vendor' files, you can make any changes or additions to styling from the styles.css file.
